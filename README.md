# Operation Result Pattern

## Purpose
This pattern serves as an alternative to throwing exceptions for handling expected or non-critical errors, 
reducing unnecessary CPU overhead. Instead of relying on exceptions for flow control,
OperationResult<T> allows you to communicate operation results (data, messages, and exceptions)
in a more structured and efficient way.

## Key Benefits
	1. Improved Performance: Throwing exceptions incurs a CPU cost, particularly in high-throughput applications where exceptions can degrade performance. OperationResult<T> avoids this by providing a lightweight way to signal success or failure.
	2. Enhanced Readability and Maintainability: Using OperationResult<T> makes code flow more intuitive, as it’s clear when an operation succeeded or failed. Methods return a result directly, making it easier for developers to handle the outcome in a structured manner.
	3. Better User and Developer Experience: This pattern provides meaningful error messages and structured results, giving both end-users and upstream services clear feedback on what went wrong. Unlike raw exceptions, which may be vague or too technical, OperationResult<T> allows for well-defined messages and context to be added.
